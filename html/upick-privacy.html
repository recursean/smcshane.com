            <div class="container px-5" style="text-align:left"
                <p>Sean McShane built the uPick - Food Suggestions app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Sean McShane at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service. If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>
                <p>For a better experience, while using my Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information: first name, family name, and email. The information that I request will be stored and used to uniquely identify users. By providing this personal information, the app is able to remember selections a user has made during previous uses of the app and helps improve the user experience. To request any information that has been collected to be deleted, see the section titled "Request Deletion of Information Collected". The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. Link to privacy policies of third party service providers used by the app:</p>

                <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.

                <p><b>Security</b></p>
                <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                <p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
